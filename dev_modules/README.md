Description

I use this directory as incubator for new modules.


Usage

```bash
npm installAll
```
For each module, you can use the ajaxModule as example.
The gulp file provided, can be used to install typing:

```bash
gulp installTypings
```
and to test:

```bash
gulp test
```
or test watching files:

```bash
gulp watch_and_test
```
